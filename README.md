# ❤️ Heart Disease Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes heart disease data from the Cleveland dataset using statistical analysis and Power BI visualizations. The goal is to identify key patterns, risk factors, and trends associated with heart disease, helping to improve understanding and decision-making in healthcare.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 📊 Data Cleaning & Processing: Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and structuring data for analysis.
- 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and distributions of key health indicators.
- 📈 Power BI Dashboard: Creating interactive visualizations to highlight risk factors and trends in heart disease.
- 🏥 Risk Factor Analysis: Studying the impact of age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits on heart disease.
- 📌 Comparative Insights: Analyzing differences between patients with and without heart disease.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL**: Data querying and filtering
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview
The Power BI report includes:
✅ Demographic Insights: Breakdown of patient data (age, gender, cholesterol levels).  
✅ Risk Factor Trends: Charts highlighting common indicators linked to heart disease.  
✅ Comparative Analysis: Visuals comparing patients with and without heart disease.  
✅ Interactive Filters: Users can explore data based on age groups, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset for broader demographic insights.  
- Add real-time data integration for monitoring trends.  
- Improve interactivity with more detailed Power BI reports.
